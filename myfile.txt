### ✅ Wednesday – August 6
**Top 3 Goals**
- [ ] Begin encrypted C2 channel (Go).
- [ ] Add AES or simple XOR fallback.
- [ ] Research Go’s `crypto/cipher` vs `x/crypto` libs.

**📝 Note**

---

### ✅ Friday – August 8
**Top 3 Goals**
- [ ] Test basic evasion payload (Go backdoor) on local Windows + Defender.
- [ ] Record how AV reacts → logs, alerts, behaviors.
- [ ] Document method for next stage bypass.

## 📝 NOTE — execydat

⚙️ You don’t need noise. You need flow.
1 shell = 100 lessons. 1 bypass = 100 hours saved.
Let the others panic. You study, build, and break in silence.
