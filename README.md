# A simple todo tui app (TodoMe)

## idea
as for me a usually use markdown files to note my todos and i get board using the normal nvim so i decided to explore BubbleTea framework for creating User Terminal Interface (TUI) application. Where i am most of the time. So why not creating a simple todo app that take my current markdown file parse it if there is an existing todos or add new ones or modifie old ones based on the today's date.

## Developement.
Currently am still exploring BubbleTea its quite fun framework. I managed to parse the file according to my current format i will try to support different formats also or even custom formats for other to use.



## todos
- [ ] imporve todo modification
- [ ] add todo to the current existing todos.
- [ ] add configuration file parser
